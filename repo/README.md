# fullstack

A full-stack retail campaign governance and content integrity platform. Marketing operations teams use it to create campaigns and coupons, submit them for dual approval, manage uploaded campaign materials, detect near-duplicate content, view analytics, and maintain an immutable audit trail. Administrators manage users, roles, anomaly alerts, and database backups. All business logic enforces role-based access, rate limiting, anti-replay nonce validation, and AES-256-GCM encryption at rest.

## Architecture and Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Language | Java 17 |
| Backend framework | Spring Boot 3.2 |
| Frontend rendering | Thymeleaf 3 + Bootstrap 5 + HTMX |
| Database | MySQL 8.0 (Flyway migrations only) |
| Security | Spring Security 6 (form login, CSRF, rate limiting, nonce validation, HMAC signing) |
| Testing | JUnit 5 + Mockito + TestRestTemplate + Testcontainers + Jest + Playwright |
| Infrastructure | Docker + Docker Compose |

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

No local Java, Maven, Node, or any other tool is required.

## Running the Application

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Open https://localhost:8080 (self-signed certificate — accept the browser warning)

## Testing

Run the full test suite (backend unit, backend API, frontend JS, and Playwright e2e) with a single command:

```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

The script orchestrates all four suites through Docker. No local tooling needed. Exit code 0 means all suites passed.

## Verification

After starting the app with `docker compose up --build`, confirm it is working:

1. Open https://localhost:8080 — accept the self-signed certificate warning, then confirm the login page loads.
2. Log in with `admin` / `Admin@Retail2024!` — confirm you reach the Admin Dashboard showing system statistics.
3. Log out, then log in with each other role and confirm the correct landing page:
   - `ops` / `Ops@Retail2024!` → Campaign list
   - `reviewer` / `Review@Retail2024!` → Approval Queue
   - `finance` / `Finance@Retail2024!` → Analytics Dashboard
   - `cs` / `CsUser@Retail2024!` → Coupon Lookup
4. Visit https://localhost:8080/health — confirm the response is `{"status":"UP","service":"retail-campaign"}`.
5. While logged in as `ops`, try to access https://localhost:8080/admin/dashboard — confirm it redirects back to the login page or shows a 403 Forbidden response.
